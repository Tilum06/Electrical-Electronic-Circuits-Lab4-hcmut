\section{Introduction}

Altium Designer is an electronic design automation software package for printed circuit board (PCB), FPGA and embedded software design, and associated library and release managementautomation. APrintedCircuitBoard(PCB)mechanicallysupportsandelec trically connects electric components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate.

In this lab, two different voltage regular circuits are designed in Altium, based on IC 7805
and LM2596. \textbf{The manuals are provided by videos}
